category,score_0_definition,score_1_definition,score_2_definition
Applicability scope,Does not apply to building projects as a legal requirement (purely informational) OR applies only as optional guidance,Applies only to a limited universe of projects (e.g., discretionary approvals/city assistance/program participation),Applies as a mandatory requirement to a broad set of building projects (e.g., building code requirement for new buildings and/or alterations)
Trigger clarity,No trigger stated OR trigger is vague/undefined (cannot tell when it applies),Trigger exists but leaves key thresholds ambiguous OR relies on discretionary determination without clear criteria,Trigger is explicit and text-scoreable (clear project types and thresholds)
Collision-risk zone definition,No defined zone (no height band and no defined “collision zone”/hazard area),Zone implied or partially defined (e.g., references risk areas but no clear dimensions),Zone explicitly defined (e.g., height band or clearly bounded “collision zone”)
Glass/material performance standard,No standard for glass/material performance (no measurable criteria),Qualitative standard only (“bird-friendly materials” without measurable threshold),Quantified or rule-based standard (measurable metric or spacing/treatment rule that can be checked)
Feature-hazard definitions,No definitions of feature hazards (fly-through, corners, parallel glass, etc.),Mentions hazards but definitions are incomplete or not operational,Defines feature hazards clearly enough to score textually
Location-hazard definitions,No location/proximity-based hazard logic,Location logic exists but is vague (unclear boundaries/criteria),Location logic is explicit (designated zones/refuges/criteria that can be identified)
Acceptable treatment specificity,No treatment guidance,Lists treatments but in a non-specific way (examples without requirements),Defines acceptable treatments with specific rules (coverage %, spacing rules, or explicit allowed treatments)
Lighting restrictions,No lighting provisions,Non-mandatory recommendations (“encourage/should”) OR limited requirements with broad carveouts,Mandatory restrictions (clear requirements on lighting with limited carveouts)
Compliance documentation requirement,No documentation requirement for compliance,Documentation is requested/encouraged but not clearly required,Documentation is required as part of review (plans/specs/certifications/checklists)
Review gate strength,No formal review checkpoint,Review exists but is informal or discretionary without a clear gate (no stated checkpoint),Clear formal gate (permit/planning/program review) that conditions approval/eligibility on compliance
Enforcement mechanism strength,No enforcement language OR explicitly voluntary,Enforcement primarily through discretionary approval/eligibility with no explicit penalty schedule,Enforcement includes explicit compliance consequences (denial/withholding approval, violations/penalties, or clearly enforceable sanctions)
Exceptions/waivers breadth,Broad/undefined exceptions that can swallow the rule,Some exceptions exist and could materially reduce coverage,Narrow, clearly delimited exceptions OR none stated
