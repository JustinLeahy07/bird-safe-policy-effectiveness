# Rubric Application Instructions (v1)

## What counts as “the policy text” for scoring
Score based on the primary legal text and its official implementation document:
- NYC: Local Law 15 + DOB Guidance
- San Francisco: Planning Code §139 + Standards for Bird-Safe Buildings
- Chicago: SDP Handbook (program requirements)

If legal text and implementation guidance conflict, note the conflict in justification and score conservatively.

## Scoring rules
Each category gets a 0/1/2 score:
- 0 = absent / voluntary / not scoreable
- 1 = present but conditional, vague, or discretionary
- 2 = mandatory, explicit, and text-scoreable

## How to write a justification (required format)
Every score must include:
1) A 1–2 sentence justification tied to specific clause structure
2) A source file reference (your excerpt filename)

Example justification:
"Applies to new buildings and alterations involving replacement of all exterior glazing filed on/after effective date; mandatory under permit review. Source: nyc_ny_ll15_dob_guidance_excerpt.md"

## Tie-breaking rules (to keep consistent)
- If something is mandatory only for a limited project universe → score 1, not 2.
- If lighting is only “recommended” → score 1, not 2.
- If enforcement exists only as an approval gate without penalties → score 1.
- If you cannot locate the clause in the excerpt file → score 0 and flag it.

## When to revise the rubric
Only revise after pilot scoring reveals ambiguity. If you revise:
- increment version (v2)
- write a short change log in docs/rubric_changelog.md
