# Policy Notes — Week 1

## Recurring Clause Types (10)

- **Applicability / scope clause** — specifies which project types are covered (new construction vs alterations vs replacement facades vs “projects seeking city action/assistance”) — Examples: nyc_ny_ll15_2020_official_text_excerpt.md; san_francisco_ca_planning_code_section_139_excerpt.md; chicago_il_sdp_bird_protection_excerpt.md
- **Trigger condition clause** — defines the precise condition that activates compliance (e.g., “replacement of all exterior glazing,” “replacement facade,” “new building construction,” “project subject to SDP”) — Examples: nyc_ny_ll15_dob_guidance_excerpt.md; san_francisco_ca_planning_code_section_139_excerpt.md; chicago_il_sdp_bird_protection_excerpt.md
- **Regulated zone clause** — limits treatment to a collision-risk zone (height band / “bird collision zone” concept) — Examples: nyc_ny_ll15_2020_official_text_excerpt.md; san_francisco_ca_bird_safe_standards_2011_excerpt.md
- **Performance standard / metric clause** — uses a measurable technical standard to define compliance (e.g., “maximum threat factor 25” standard for bird-friendly materials) — Examples: nyc_ny_ll15_2020_official_text_excerpt.md; nyc_ny_ll15_dob_guidance_excerpt.md
- **Hazard-definition clause (feature-related hazards)** — defines specific architectural hazards (e.g., fly-through conditions, bird hazard installations, glass corners/parallel glass) — Examples: nyc_ny_ll15_2020_official_text_excerpt.md; san_francisco_ca_planning_code_section_139_excerpt.md
- **Hazard-definition clause (location-related hazards)** — defines risk based on siting (e.g., designated refuge areas / proximity-based triggers) — Examples: san_francisco_ca_planning_code_section_139_excerpt.md; san_francisco_ca_bird_safe_standards_2011_excerpt.md
- **Acceptable-treatment clause** — lists what counts as an acceptable façade/glazing treatment (patterning rules, treatment coverage, etc.) — Examples: san_francisco_ca_bird_safe_standards_2011_excerpt.md; nyc_ny_ll15_dob_guidance_excerpt.md
- **Compliance documentation clause** — specifies what must be submitted to prove compliance (construction documents/material specs; sometimes checklists/certification) — Examples: nyc_ny_ll15_dob_guidance_excerpt.md; chicago_il_sdp_bird_protection_excerpt.md
- **Review-gate clause** — embeds bird-safety in an approval checkpoint (DOB permit review; Planning review; SDP review/eligibility) — Examples: nyc_ny_ll15_dob_guidance_excerpt.md; san_francisco_ca_planning_code_section_139_excerpt.md; chicago_il_sdp_bird_protection_excerpt.md
- **Exemptions / non-applicability clause** — explicitly excludes certain projects or creates carveouts (or implies carveouts by narrow triggers) — Examples: nyc_ny_ll15_dob_guidance_excerpt.md; chicago_il_sdp_bird_protection_excerpt.md

## Recurring Loopholes (5)

- **“Replace all exterior glazing” narrow trigger** — major renovations that replace only some glazing can avoid coverage — Example: nyc_ny_ll15_dob_guidance_excerpt.md
- **Conditional participation / limited universe** — requirements apply only to projects in a specific approval/assistance pathway rather than universal building code coverage — Example: chicago_il_sdp_bird_protection_excerpt.md
- **Points-menu voluntariness** — bird protection competes with other credits/strategies, so developers can meet requirements without choosing bird protection — Example: chicago_il_sdp_bird_protection_excerpt.md
- **No standalone penalty section in SF §139 — compliance pressure comes through approval/permit gates rather than an explicit fine/penalty schedule in the section — Example: san_francisco_ca_planning_code_section_139_excerpt.md
- **Implementation-document dependence** — key operational details live in a standards/design guide rather than the code text, creating ambiguity if documents diverge or change — Example: san_francisco_ca_bird_safe_standards_2011_excerpt.md

## Enforcement Mechanisms (3)

- **DOB permit review gate (mandatory)** — compliance is enforced through permitting/plan review tied to construction documents — Example: nyc_ny_ll15_dob_guidance_excerpt.md
- **Planning Department approval gate (mandatory when triggered)** — compliance reviewed during SF Planning approval for new construction/replacement facades that qualify as bird hazards — Example: san_francisco_ca_planning_code_section_139_excerpt.md
- **Program compliance gate (conditional/weak) — applies only to projects in SDP universe; compliance is checked through SDP review/documentation/audit processes rather than citywide code penalties — Example: chicago_il_sdp_bird_protection_excerpt.md
