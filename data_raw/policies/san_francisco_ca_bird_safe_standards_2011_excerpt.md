## Purpose of Standards
These standards provide detailed design guidance to implement Planning Code Section 139 and reduce bird collisions through architectural and material choices.

---

## Hazard Classification
Bird hazards are classified based on building location, façade design, and proximity to sensitive habitats. Feature hazards include transparent glass, reflective surfaces, and architectural conditions that simulate open flight paths.

---

## Treatment Standards
Acceptable treatments include patterned glazing with specific spacing requirements, fritted glass, external screens, and other visible design elements that interrupt reflections and transparency.

---

## Applicability Conditions
The standards apply to projects identified as bird hazards under Planning Code Section 139, including new construction and significant façade modifications.

---

## Compliance / Review
Design proposals are reviewed by Planning Department staff to assess consistency with bird-safe standards.

---

## Notes
This document translates ordinance language into specific design criteria that can be evaluated during project review.
