## Applicability / Scope
This section applies to buildings that present bird hazards due to their location, height, or architectural features, including buildings located within designated Urban Bird Refuges or adjacent to such areas.

---

## Trigger / Threshold
Bird-safe building standards are triggered when a project includes new construction, replacement of glazing, or installation of architectural features that meet the definition of bird hazards as specified in the code.

Bird hazard is defined as a building or feature that increases the likelihood of bird collisions due to reflective or transparent surfaces. Feature hazards include glass corners, parallel glass surfaces, and clear passage illusions.

---

## Glass / Façade Treatment Requirements
Projects must incorporate bird-safe design treatments to mitigate identified hazards. Acceptable treatments include patterned glass, fritting, or other design measures that reduce reflectivity or transparency.

---

## Compliance / Review Mechanism
Compliance is reviewed by the Planning Department during the project approval process to ensure bird-safe design standards are met.

---

## Enforcement / Penalties
