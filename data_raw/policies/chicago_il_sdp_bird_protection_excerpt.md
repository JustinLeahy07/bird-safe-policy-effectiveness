## Applicability / Scope
The Sustainable Development Policy applies to projects that seek city assistance, zoning changes, planned developments, or other forms of discretionary approval by the City of Chicago.

---

## Bird Protection / Bird-Friendly Design Provisions
The policy includes bird-friendly design strategies as part of its sustainability framework, encouraging the use of collision-reducing materials, façade treatments, and lighting considerations.

---

## Compliance / Review Mechanism
Compliance with bird protection strategies is evaluated as part of the broader Sustainable Development Policy review process associated with project approvals.

---

## Enforcement / Penalties
No standalone enforcement mechanism; compliance occurs through SDP participation requirements tied to project approval or eligibility for city assistance.

---

## Exceptions / Waivers
Not specified.

---

## Notes
This policy functions as a programmatic framework rather than a mandatory ordinance, and bird protection measures operate through conditional participation rather than universal enforcement.
